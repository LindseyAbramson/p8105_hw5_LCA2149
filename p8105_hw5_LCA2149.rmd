# Problem 1

```{r}
bday_sim = function(n_room) {
  
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room

  repeated_bday
  
}

#Test the function
bday_sim(20)
```

Run simulation for group sizes 2 to 50, with 10,000 iterations each.
```{r}
bday_sim_results = 
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 2:50, 
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    result = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    bdays
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(result)
  )
```

Plot the results.
```{r}
bday_sim_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) + 
  geom_point(color="lightpink") + 
  geom_line(color="red") +
  labs(
    title = "Birthday Problem Simulation",
    subtitle = "Probability of at least two people sharing a birthday",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```


The birthday paradox simulation reveals that with just 23 people, there's over a 50% chance of shared birthdays, which contradicts most people's intuitive expectations. The probability rises rapidly, reaching about 90% with 41 people and nearly 97% with 50 people, demonstrating how quickly coincidences become likely. This highlights how human intuition often underestimates probability when dealing with multiple pair combinations rather than specific matches.



## Problem 2

```{r}
n <- 30
sigma <- 5
mu_values <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# storage
power <- numeric(7)
avg_all <- numeric(7)
avg_reject <- numeric(7)

for (j in 1:7) {
  mu <- mu_values[j]
  estimates <- numeric(5000)
  pvals <- numeric(5000)
  
  for (i in 1:5000) {
    x <- rnorm(n, mu, sigma)
    test <- t.test(x)
    estimates[i] <- test$estimate
    pvals[i] <- test$p.value
  }
  
  power[j] <- mean(pvals < 0.05)
  avg_all[j] <- mean(estimates)
  avg_reject[j] <- mean(estimates[pvals < 0.05])
}

# Plot 1
plot(mu_values, power, type = "b", xlab = "True μ", ylab = "Power")

```

There is a clear positive relationship between power and effect size. As true effect size increases, the power grows rapidly at risk and then starts to approach 1. 


```{r}
# Plot 2  
plot(mu_values, avg_all, type = "b", col = "blue", 
     xlab = "True μ", ylab = "Average Estimate")
lines(mu_values, avg_reject, type = "b", col = "red")
legend("topleft", c("All tests", "Rejected only"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)
```

The average estimate from rejected tests is only approximately equal to the true μ for larger effect sizes (4-6), but is biased upward for smaller effect sizes (0-3). This happens because when the true effect is small, we only reject the null hypothesis in samples where the random variation exaggerates the effect size. For larger true effects (μ=4-6), this bias disappears because the test has high power and rejects the null for nearly all samples, not just the extreme ones.


## Problem 3

```{r}
homicide_data <- read.csv("homicide-data.csv")
```

The homicide dataset includes information on homicides in 50 large US cities (including Atlanta, Houston, LA, Philly, etc). The dataset includes uid, reported date, victim full name, race, age, and sex, city, state, lat, long, and the disposition (case status). The raw dataset includes these 12 variables and 52,179 cases.

```{r}
# Create city_state variable

homicide_data =
  homicide_data |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)
  )
```

```{r}
# Summarize within cities
city_summary<-homicide_data |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarise(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition == c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")))

kable(city_summary)
```
